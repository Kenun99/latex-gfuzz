\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Experiment Environment}


\subsection{Correctness}

\subsubsection{Motivation.}
We need to ensure the bytecode transaction is function equivalent. To this end, we collect POC from the Ethereum community and replay on CPU and GPU to compare the storage contents. 
% evaluate the sanitizers as well.
