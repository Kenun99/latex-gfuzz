\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Experiment Environment}
All experiments were performed on a server running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with dual Intel Xeon Gold 6226R CPUs, 512 GB RAM and one Nvidia RTX3090-24G.
The CUDA library version is v11.3.
%
We ask GPU to run 4,096 streaming multiprocessors (SM). Each SM schedules 32 CUDA cores. 
%
For each smart contract, we test XXX minutes. The total experiment costs XXX CPU days. 

\subsection{Correctness}
\label{rq:correctness}

\subsubsection{Motivation}
We need to ensure the bytecode transaction is function equivalent. To this end, we collect POC from the Ethereum community and replay on CPU and GPU to compare the storage contents. 
% evaluate the sanitizers as well.
