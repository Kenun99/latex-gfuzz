\section{Conclusion}
We design and develop {\tool}, a novel fuzzer that converts EVM contracts to PTX contracts to test on SIMD GPU and provides an snapshot strategies to the smart contract in different stages.

We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate {\tool}, and the experimental results show that the throughput of {\tool} can reach XXX, which exceeds all existing tools XX.
