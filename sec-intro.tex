\section{Introduction}

The existing fuzzers on smart contract have to run the bytecode in a virtual machine and access the blockchain database to record storage changes. 

Some parallel fuzzers can test the target in several threads. All threads share an identical seed pool\cite{afl, aflfast, enfuzz, }.
