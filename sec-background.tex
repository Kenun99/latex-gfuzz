\section{Background}

\subsection{Smart Contracts}
Smart contracts are kind of decentralized application running blockchain. 
Every peer node can execute the smart contract to update blockchain database with consistency. 
Ethereum-favor smart contracts are widely adopted by the popular blockchains, such as Ethereum\cite{wood2014ethereum}, Binance\cite{}, Polkadot\cite{}, DAI\cite{}, TRON\cite{} and Avalanche\cite{}.
These smart contracts are mainly written in Solidity\cite{solidity} and then compiled into bytecode.
Each EVM bytecode is a sequence of opcodes, which can be interpreted by a virtual machine (i.e., EVM) to 1) read input from the read-only \textit{calldata}; 2) operate runtime operands on \textit{stack}; 3) access a linear \textit{memory}; 4) and store persistent data on \textit{storage}.
Some opcodes are named blockchain APIs because they can access blockchain database and use EVM utility, such as contract calls, storage accesses and keccak256 computation. 

\subsection{CUDA}
% (TBD)
CUDA is a parallel computing platform that allows software to use GPUs for general purpose computation.
